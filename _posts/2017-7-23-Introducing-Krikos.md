title: Introducing Krikos - An Introductory Neural Network Framework in Python
permalink: /blog/Krikos

I am pleased to announce that I have published my first Python framework: Krikos!

If you have been following my previous posts, you have followed along with me as I developed a neural network micro-framework, which I have been using to augment my tutorial series. I realized that this was a super cool project which I wanted to make accessible to anyone by open-sourcing it and making it available on PyPI. Now, anyone can contribute to Krikos, and anyone can use it to start learning about and experimenting with neural networks. As a slimmed down neural network framework, it is perfect for the novice AI researcher: it is simple enough to pick up quickly, but barebones enough that you are heavily involved in the development of your NN.
