Welcome to my blog! I'm so glad you're here. :D

I'll be writing on this blog periodically, but more frequently these next few months as I'm on summer break. I'll be writing some cool articles on neural networks, CS education, and perhaps even Philosophy! I have a few projects planned out for the summer, and will be writing short pieces on them once they are completed. Below is the list, which will be updated with post links as they are published:

* [Neural network overview](https://medium.com/@shubhang.desai/a-soft-introduction-to-neural-networks-6986b5e3a127)
* [Modular neural network framework](http://shubhangdesai.github.io/blog/Modular-NN-Mini-Framework)
* Simple CNN using modular framework
* Simple RNN using modular framework
* Building a feedforward for artistic style transfer
* Flask DNN demo boilerplate
* Using LSTMs to predict stock market prices
* Deep networks for black-and-white image colorization
* PlatoRNN: an RNN which can philosophize
* Creating a GAN to forge faces
* Developing an RNN which can make EDM music
* Teaching a network to play Pong
* How to teach an ML workshop

Hope you all keep up with my writings and have an awesome summer!
